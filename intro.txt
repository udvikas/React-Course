React is clint-side JS library for building the user interface.
React makes building the complex, interactive reactive user interface simpler.
all about building modern, reactive user interface for the web.
Declarative, component focused approach
user ==> request to ==> server
user <== response(HTML page) <== server
jS runs in the browser --> on Loaded Page 

Section 1:

4). Building Single page applicataion
React can be used to control parts of HTML page or entire page.
React can also be used to control the entire front end of  a web applicataion.
Widget approach(on multipage applicataion)-->  some pages are still rendered on and served by backEnd server
SPA approach --> Server only sends one html page. thereafter React takes over and control the UI.

5). Alternative to React
React: Lean and focused component based UI-library. certain features(eg. routing) are
added via Community packages.
Angular: Complete component based UI library frameWork packed with features.
use of TypeScript can be overskill for smaller projects
Vue JS: Complete component based UI library frameWork packed with features
A bit less popular than Angular & React.
features Comparison: Angular > React > Vue JS

Section 2:
classes: classes are used by React to create its components.

Section 3: React basics and working with components.
React embraces a concept called component.
component: Reusable building blocks in user interface.

Reusability: Don't repeat yourself
separation of course: Don't do too many things in one and the same place(function)
Split big chunks of code into multiple smaller functions.
html + css + JS --> React 
component are combination of HTML, CSS & JS
React is all about component and about building these components.

React allows you to build these re-usable
and reactive components consisting of HTML and JavaScript
React uses something which is called a declarative approach
for building these components.
